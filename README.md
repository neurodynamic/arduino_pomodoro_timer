Code for Arduino device that automatically times Pomodoro shifts and breaks


This code has been written for an Arduino device that monitors how long I have been sitting in my work chair and makes me take breaks accordingly. It is written to roughly emulate Pomodoro-style breaks, timing a 24 minute work shift, followed by a (at time of writing) five minute "limbo" phase to finish any work that I'm right in the middle of doing, followed by a five minute break. The beginning and end of a break is signaled by a buzzer playing particular sounds or brief musical riffs that I have borrowed shamelessly from Final Fantasy VII.
